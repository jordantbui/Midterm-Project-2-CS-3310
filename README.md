Sum Finder Program

Given an array on numbers and a desired sum, this program searches the given array for any 2 numbers that add up to the given sum and displays the two numbers as well as the sum.
- Tests Brute force for sorted and unsorted random arrays.
- Tests Hash Map method for sorted and unsorted random arrays. (Same algorithm used for sorted and unsorted arrays)
- Displays Run Times for each method tested on both sorted and unsorted arrays for all array sizes.
- Array of numbers and sum are randomly generated.
